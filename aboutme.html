            Hi, I'm Fasteroid!  Nice to meet you!<br>
            <br>
            I'm a student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.  
            My current studies are taking place at <a href="https://www.udel.edu/">University of Delaware</a>,
            but I'll be transferring to <a href="https://www.wilmu.edu/">Wilmington University</a>
            next semester for much needed quality of life improvements.<br>
            <br>
            I began writing my first original lines of code early to mid 2014, in a little-known language called
            Expression 2 from the popular sandbox game <i>Garry's Mod</i>.  Learning E2 was a very trial-by-error
            sort of process, since there was very little information online about it.  In the very beginning, I
            literally learned by changing single characters of public scripts and observing the effects if it ran.  
            By 2015 however, once I really started understanding basic syntax, it turned into a massive power
            trip and I was instantly hooked.  I've been bending digital reality to my will ever since.<br>
            <br>
            As a result of this learning style, I've gotten pretty good at learning from few examples and
            reverse-engineering code.  Perhaps you'll find this of interest, future employers&hellip; :&rpar; <br>
            <br>
            I still have more to say, but it's going on 2am as of writing this.  I'll continue this another time.<br>
