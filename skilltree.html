                Welcome to the skill tree, now complete with physics!<br>
                <br>
                &emsp;&emsp;In many video games, trees are used as progression systems.  The game developer chooses a root node,
                and the player is then left to choose which branches to explore first.  The player also often given only a limited
                number of branches to explore.  This means there is strategy involved in growing the tech treeâ€”will you be a 
                one-trick pony, or a jack of all trades and master of none?<br>
                <br>
                I've chosen to specialize in primarily in computer science, but my creative side has historically gotten the best
                of me on the engineering and a/v branches.<br>
                <br>
                Roll over or tap a node to see its description.  You can also drag them around if they get stuck or tangled.

                DISCLAIMER: Some of the logos on this page have been modified to fit better
                as background images.  I add transparency, remove text, and occasionally
                desaturate colors to improve text readability.  I am aware of a 
                few logos for which these edits go against usage policy (Bootstrap, Ubuntu).<br>
                <br>
                If something I've done is truly horrible, you can
                <a href="https://github.com/Fasteroid/fasteroid.github.io/issues/new/choose">open an issue</a>
                on my Github and I'll remove all traces of your logo within 24 hours, no questions asked.
