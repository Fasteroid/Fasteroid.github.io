                Hi, I'm Fasteroid!  Nice to meet you!<br>
                <br>
                I'm a student pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science.  
                I have officially transferred to <a href="https://www.wilmu.edu/">Wilmington University</a> to pursue
                both the more practical knowledge its courses will teach me and its unique quarterly course format.  
                It is objectively better than University of Delaware.<br>
                <br>
                I began writing my first original lines of code early to mid 2014, in a little-known language
                called Expression 2 from the popular sandbox game <i>Garry's Mod</i>.  E2 had a very steep learning 
                curve to it at first due to its obscurity and narrow scope of applications, but by 2015 it had turned
                into a massive power trip for me and I was hooked.  Nowadays I'm severely burned out on the language,
                but still plenty capable of assisting others with it.<br>
                <br>
                Due to the experiment-and-observe process of how I taught myself E2, I've gotten pretty good at
                reverse-engineering unfamiliar code.  While I can't deobfuscate purposefully difficult code, I <i>have</i> written
                some inspector tools for browser developer consoles that let me really dig into what websites are doing.  
                I have both seen and done things on front-ends that I really <i>shouldn't</i> have been able to (°͜>°)

                My biggest real life achievements have been those in Odyssey of the Mind, which is a collaborative 
                problem-solving extracurricular for creative thinkers.  Each year, teams of 5-7 choose
                one of five long-term problems (which all involve some combination of acting and engineering),
                and are assigned an 8-minute 'spontaneous' problem the day of the performance.<br>
                <br>
                With the help of my father as the team coach (who's just there to organize and keep us on track),
                and my wonderful teammates,
                we managed a World Finalist status four times in a row from 2016 to 2019, with a second place 
                victory for Problem 2 Division III in 2019 (<a href="https://www.odysseyofthemind.com/wf2019/world-finals-2019-scores">scores here</a>).<br>
                <br>
                Odyssey of the Mind taught me a lot—mainly that it usually isn't feasable for one person to work on everything\.  
                Different people have different strengths and weaknesses, and if one person does everything, they're bound to hit
                a weakness eventually.  In contrast, with good teamwork and good skill coverage, even an intelligent adversary
                will struggle to pick something that truly defeats everyone on the team.<br>

                title="Friends on E2 Beyond Infinity.">
                I currently spend my days managing and growing my two Garry's Mod servers, <i>E2 Beyond Infinity</i> and <i>Props Beyond Infinity</i>.  
                One is a programming and scripting paradise, and the other is a prop hunt server with some custom gameplay features.<br>
                <br>
                One of the coolest features of both these servers is the presence of a bidirectional Discord Relay I designed, which allows seamless two-way 
                interaction between players on the Garry's Mod server and users in its Discord server.  This relay has proved to serve
                many practical applications, ranging from posting memes in the in-game chat to running commands remotely from up to 8,000 miles away.    
                It's not a unique idea by any means, but it's 100% my unique implementation.  I'm very proud of it!<br>
                <br>
                As of about 6 months ago, I used money acquired via server donations to purchase a new dedicated machine for the server.  It runs Linux now instead of Windows.
                Server performance has been significantly better since this upgrade—most E2 scripts (which run serverside) take just half the time they used to.
                The server also tolerates the other crap we put it through a lot better now, such as spawning hundreds of physics entities in confined spaces.  
                I'd call that a business success, don't you think?

                That's the end of my TL;DR.<br>
                If I've piqued your interest at all, you should check out my <a href=skilltree.html>technical skill tree</a> and learn more about what I can do.  
                Perhaps I can be of use to you!<br>
