            &emsp;&emsp;I'll cut the philosophy and cut to the <i>trace</i>â€”this thing was an absolutely terrible idea 
            in retrospect.  Who would be such an idiot as to write a raytracer that runs serverside, in an interpreted language
            built upon another interpreted language?  Yup.  That would be me.<br>
            <br>
            While I may not work on this anymore because the codebase is a mess and the thing is way too slow, I still showcase
            it here because of the incredible journey it took me on.  From the very beginning, where simultaneous reflection and transparency
            forced me to conquer recursion for the first time, to the very end where I learned my life was a lie and none of this was physically
            accurate to real-life, without this project having existed I'd be a very different person today.<br>
            <br>
            Special thanks to my old friend <a href="https://discord.com/users/331192747933302837">@Speedeo</a> (bitmaps), and more
            recently <a href="https://discord.com/users/363590853140152321">@Vurv</a> (pnglib) for helping me encode my traces into
            these mostly-to-spec images. <br>
