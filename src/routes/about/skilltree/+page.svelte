                &emsp;&emsp;In many video games, trees are used as progression systems.  The game developer chooses a root node,
                and the player is then left to choose which branches to explore first.  The player also often given only a limited
                number of branches to explore.  This means there is strategy involved in growing the tech treeâ€”will you be a 
                one-trick pony, or a jack of all trades and master of none?<br>
                <br>
                I've chosen to specialize in primarily in computer science, but my creative side has historically gotten the best
                of me on the engineering and a/v branches.<br>

                Roll over or tap a node to see its description.  You can also drag them around if they get stuck or tangled.
