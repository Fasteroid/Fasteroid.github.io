                This page is an attempt to show the relationships between artists I follow on Soundcloud.<br/>
                <br/>
                Every following forms an edge in the graph which pulls its participants closer togetherâ€”which
                after some time will pull the whole graph into a semi-stable configuration.<br/>
                The resulting spatial layout can then be used to infer various social structures such as bands, communities, and collectives.<br/>
                <br/>
                This graph can be panned and zoomed by dragging and scrolling, or by touch if you're on mobile.<br/>
                Clicking or tapping an artist will bring you to their soundcloud page in a new tab.<br/>
                Hovering an artist will reveal their edges and increase the forces to show how they connect to the bigger picture.<br/>
