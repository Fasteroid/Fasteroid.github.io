                And I get embarassed every time someone asks!  Answering that would require catching them up on a rabbit hole YEARS in the making.  
                Not something EITHER of us would have time for in the setting of an icebreaker question like this.

                I made this page instead to refer people to when they ask.  Click on an artist to listen!

                        Almost every artist here has a featured track.  How am I picking those?

                            <li>For most tracks, popularity is determined as a combination of plays, likes, and comments squared divided by age.</li>

                                it is "timeless", and will divide by its ranking there instead of age.

                            <li>This means if there's not a significant difference in stats, Legendary Favorites are preferred.  <i>But not always.</i></li>

                        Artists with a LOT of followers have more negative space around them.

                        Graph edges (click a node to view them) also show if two artists are following each other or not.

            PS: If you find something weird in this graph, it's probably a meme or shitpost account.  I'm following a few of those here.
