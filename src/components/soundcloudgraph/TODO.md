# Todo list of stuff to try because there's so much

## EDGES
    - Render additively?
    - Experiment with animation


## AUTO FOCUS
    - What if click on a node to autofocus instead of hover?

## NODES
    - Size...
        - based on liked_count?
        - based on followers_count?
        - maybe both somehow?

## TRAVERSAL
    - Mousing nodes to pan to them was actually kind of nice.  Explore this further...
        - Do we even need panzoom if we do this?
