# Todo list of stuff to try because there's so much

## VFX
    - Add an "on fire" effect that correlates to legendary favorites playlist
    - Add another effect that comes from the relics playlist


## Bugs
    - Fix text imprecision on small nodes by scaling everything up

## Exploits
    - If possible, can we animate the nodes in sync with the music being played?  Might be impossible because of CORS restrictions.
