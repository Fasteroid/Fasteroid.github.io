# Todo list of stuff to try because there's so much

## EDGES
    - Render additively? (looked decent)
    - Experiment with animation


## AUTO FOCUS
    - What if click on a node to autofocus instead of hover?

## NODES
    - Size based on number of likes makes the structure less fluid... common neighborhoods are more rare.  Do we want this?

## PERFORMANCE
    - See if verlet integration lets us dodge any expensive computations
    - Investigate `will-change: transform` CSS
    - Only update what's (currently) on-screen
    - Employ web workers
    - Look at D3 again?

## TRAVERSAL
    - Mousing nodes to pan to them was actually kind of nice.  Explore this further...
        - Do we even need panzoom if we do this?
