# Todo list of stuff to try because there's so much

## TRAVERSAL
    - Mousing nodes to pan to them was actually kind of nice.  Explore this further...
        - Do we even need panzoom if we do this?

## VFX
    - Add an "on fire" effect that correlates to legendary favorites playlist
    - Add another effect that comes from the relics playlist

## SHADERS
    - Might be possible to find average color of each soundcloud avatar
        - If so, can we make the edges be gradients between those?

    - Glowy laser edges
