                For those unfamiliar, hunter plates are a subset of the default construction props in Garry's Mod.  They are my
                favorite props to build with, and are objectively the most popular within the Garry's Mod community.<br>
                <br>
                There's just one problem.  The tiles that comprise these plates are impossible to split apart by normal means.  
                This meant that in the past, if I ever wanted to trim off excess, cut out shapes, or split faces, I had to 
                manually reconstruct new and complex arrangements of plates to fit my desires.  Doing this was both time intensive
                and often wasteful in terms of entity count.<br>
                <br>
                So guess what?  About a year after concieving the idea, I'm proud to present my hunter plate cutter to the world—the hottest new
                thing since Precision Alignment!  Now you can rip hunter plates along their seams like plywood boards on a table saw!<br>
                <br>
                This E2 aims to solve all three of the aforementioned problems in a single group of shared utilities.  These 
                utilities are all powered by one piece of code—a recursive plate building function.  It can take orders
                for any size hunter plate (even those that don't exist) and spawn it at any location and angle—all without
                requiring prop resizing or custom models! This function not only allows you to summon whatever size 
                plates your builds call for, but also lets you to cut them in half and punch out holes of custom dimensions.<br>
