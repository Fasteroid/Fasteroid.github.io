                Predictability arising from randomness?  What is this, did I somehow reverse-engineer Desmos's RNG, or is this actually real?<br>
                <br>
                While reverse-engineering RNG would have been really cool, no, I didn't have to do that for this graph—all I needed was statistics.  
                Just like the physical variant shown to the right, this digital Galton board (also called a quincunx or bean-machine) demonstrates 
                two statistical phenomenon: regression to the mean and central limit theorem.<br>
                <br>
                First, I'll explain regression to the mean—the balls are less likely to bounce towards the outside since there are literally less
                paths that take the balls there.  Consider a 4-tiered pegboard like the default configuration for this graph.  To reach the leftmost slot, the 
                <b>ONLY</b> way to get there is to bounce left four times, which has a <b>1 in 16</b> probability if bouncing left is equally as likely 
                as bouncing right.  By contrast, there are <b>6 unique ways</b> to reach the middle slot (can you count them all?)—a <b></b>6 in 16</b> probability.  
                As a result, the balls are biased to be closer to the center.<br>
                <br>
                Secondly, central limit theorem—it is well known among staticians that taking many random samples from an unknown distribution will
                commonly approximate a normal distribution.  Our Galton board with 100 balls is really just 100 random samples from an unknown sampling, so
                central limit theorem applies in this case.  As a result, both my digital version with perfect binomial distribution AND the physical board with 
                chaotic physics-based distribution produce similar bell curves, even though the individual balls don't actually have the same behavior.  <b>MAGIC!</b><br>
                <br>
                This graph went on to earn me my first and only ever Reddit platinum award on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/desmos/comments/hhv5a3/galton_board_w_physics/">r/desmos</a>.<br>
