                &emsp;&emsp;I'll cut the philosophy and cut to the <i>trace</i>—this thing was an absolutely terrible idea 
                in retrospect.  Who would be such an idiot as to write a rendering engine that runs SERVERSIDE, in a  
                language that's effectively interpreted TWICE?  Yup, it was me.  That said, I've learned a lot over the two years I've 
                been developing this tracer over—mostly how O(n) in practice feels a lot longer than you expect, and how anything that 
                takes O(n^2) or longer is a disgrace to computer scientists everywhere.  And yes, I realize that includes my entire tracer 
                since the screen is n by n.  This thing should never have even been allowed to exist—because now I'm stuck in a situation
                where I can't add anything else to it without bringing render times to a snail's pace.  It sucks.<br>
                <br>
                Despite its problematic status today, however, I still love my raytracer.  The lifelike images it generates give me a
                feeling of satisfaction I have yet to observe anywhere else.<br>
                <br>
                Special thanks to my old friend <a href=https://discord.com/users/331192747933302837>@Speedeo</a> (bitmaps), and more
                recently <a href=https://discord.com/users/331192747933302837>@Vurv</a> (pnglib) for helping me encode my traces into
                these mostly-to-spec images. <br>
