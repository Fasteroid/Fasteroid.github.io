                When it comes to creating custom 3D models in E2, holograms are really the only way to do it.  Since their addition
                to Expression 2 over 10 years ago however, they've still been relatively difficult to work with for developers.<br>
                <br>
                Picture something cool, like a car, cat, or boat with a tophat.  Next, break that cool thing into primitive shapes, 
                like spheres, domes, cubes, cylinders, pyramids, etc.  Finally, enter the coordinates, angles, and scales of those
                shapes into your E2.<br>
                <br>
                <i>Surely nothing can go wrong with the last step, right?</i><br>
                <br>
                Not even Notch could do this reliably for Minecraft's mobs!  The most iconic mob of the game, the creeper, originated
                from a failed pig model, where the height and length of the torso were mistakenly swapped.<br>
                <br>
                <div style="clear: both;"></div>
                I envisioned a better way.  What if instead of typing in the coordinates, you could just intuitively position
                and scale things yourself, with no numbers required?  What if better yet, there was a library that could also
                automate spawning these structures for you?<br>
                <br>
                This is where I now introduce it to you: A VR hologram "CAD" program for Garry's Mod, that works <i>in conjunction</i>
                with a library system that can spawn these creations with a <i>single line of code</i>.<br>
                <br>
                Now isn't that fantastic?  Not to mention convenient!  Now get out there and make your dreams with this thing!
