                This was just a massive 'what if' project constructed to put to rest
                some thought experiments involving the behavior of the Physics Gun in real life.<br>
                <br>
                The 'what if' was this: <i>What if the physics gun obeyed the laws of physics?  </i>
                The way it is in unmodded sandbox, the physics gun violates Newton's Third Law, 
                as moving objects with it does not produce any reaction forces on the player.  
                This allows for techniques such as prop surfing, where players can fly at high speed
                by standing on objects and lifting them.  Some may find this entertaining, but
                I see it as a physics atrocity.  If this worked in real life, we'd already be visiting
                other star systems by now.  I had to do something.<br>
                <br>
                With a little vector math, calculus, and quaternion magic, I was able to rework
                the physics gun—adding back neglected reaction forces and coupling held objects
                to the player.  The results of this were very entertaining—I discovered several
                new physically accurate tricks and gimmicks that aren't possible with the stock
                physics gun.  Such features included wedging the player between walls, scaling 
                buildings with hook-shaped props, and even using the inertia of heavy props to 
                fling myself around the map.<br>
                <br>
                Truly one of the most entertaining E2 chips I've ever written.<br>
                It's short too—only around 120 lines of code.<br>
                <br>
                Special thanks to <a href=https://discord.com/users/347893446897434624/>@Jacbo</a> for
                providing me the code in the <i>pointVel</i> function.
